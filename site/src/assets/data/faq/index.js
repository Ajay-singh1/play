                "Sign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free access, because the Playground is not a crypto mine. The Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. ",
                "Requiring users to sign up  and register a user account keeps the Playground a safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in the Meshery Playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts. ",

                "Yes, the Meshery Playground is reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments that you may have created will be lost (e.g.only MeshMap Visualizer is reset). All of your work in Meshery UI and MeshMap Designer will remain in your user account.",

            category: "Meshery Playground",
            answer: [
                "The Cloud Native Playground (aka Meshery Playground) is a managed instance of Meshery that offers a sandbox environment in which half of MeshMap functionality is enabled (Designer mode) and the other half of MeshMap functionality is disabled (Visualizer mode).",
                "The sandbox environment is not connected to an active Kuberentes cluster, and as such, depending upon which Meshery Playgrouns environment you use specific actions within MeshMap Designer are also disabled. Meshery and MeshMap are feature-rich, sophisticated management applications for cloud native infrastructure. To access their full set of capabilities, simply deploy your own copy of Meshery into the environment of your choosing.",
